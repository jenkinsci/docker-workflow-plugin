    Records the fact that a Docker image was used by this build.

    <strong>Deprecated:</strong> Fingerprints produced by this step are not used anywhere, and the parsing code has major limitations. 
    See https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-workflow-plugin/pull/149#issuecomment-451305522 and https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/k13SfZcBWVg/iQghmCQrEAAJ

    If are a user of the Docker Traceability plugin you need to call this Step manually during the build. The mentioned limitations
    will limit the useability of this step for this purpose.
